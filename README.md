# Welcome to the TekMovies project!

This project is a simple web app that allows you to search for movies using the Open Movie Database (OMDb) API. It is built using ReactJS and CSS.

To use the app, simply enter the title of a movie in the search bar and click the search button. The app will display a list of movies that match your search query, along with the year of release and a brief summary of each movie.

You can also use the app to browse popular movies by clicking on the "Popular Movies" button. This will display a list of the most popular movies according to the OMDb API.

The app has a responsive design, so it will work on devices of all sizes. It is also fully accessible, with support for screen readers and other assistive technologies.

I hope you enjoy using the Movies project! Let me know if you have any questions or feedback.
